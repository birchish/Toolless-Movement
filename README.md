# Toolless Movement

This project is based on [GodotSourceEngineMovemen](https://github.com/atlrvrse/GodotSourceEngineMovement) and code from the [Source SDK 2013](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013). Without them I would not have been able to make this.

## Goal

The goal is to replicate Source game movement, such as strafing, bunny hopping, and trimping.
