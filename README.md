# Toolless Movement

This project is based on [GodotSourceEngineMovemen](https://github.com/atlrvrse/GodotSourceEngineMovement) and code from the [Source SDK 2013](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013). Without them I would not have been able to make this.

## Goal

The goal is to replicate Source game movement, such as strafing, bunny hopping, and trimping.

## Notes

This repository requires a modified version of Godot 4.4.1. that includes a function to normalize a vector and return the magnitude of it. It is currently not possible to build it otherwise.
